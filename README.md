# Brand New Codebase, Ain't Got No Keys

![car-no-keys.gif](assets/car-no-keys.gif)

‚úÖ Important! Install `live-keys` in a NEW FOLDER, as a NEW PROJECT. It is a separate codebase to your other project. 

Once you establish your `keys.json` file treat it like any other key. Safely, securely, and offline unless you know what you're doing.

‚ùå Super Duper Important Details, Don't Worry It's Okay!

Did you read the note above? `live-keys` is a key in itself. It is a standalone, separate server and application to your main codebase. To present your system safely: turn off the electricity! Flick the switch off and don't zap yourself. So, DO NOT INSTALL `live-keys` in your main codebase. Start a new project with a new folder! 

This separation is how your keys are obfuscated: a simple HTTP call, offline. 

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è `live-keys` is an Express-based tool that helps you build in public more safely and show more of your process.

How:
1. It runs as a separate local server, acting as a simple proxy for your API keys, preventing them from being exposed during live streams, videos, or presentations. 
2. This allows you to create a collection of API and environment keys for public building, store it one time with `live-keys` and then use it repeatedly. 

What:
1. Keep environment secrets out of plain sight, from .env files to surprise terminal outputs. 
2. Outputs from `live-keys` are designed to be informative, educational and reflect best practice by allowing people to expose environment secrets like .env files. Configure API fails to display either `404` or a friendlier `null` as you demonstrate full processes.
3. This is essentially an agnostic, open source, cross compatible version of "secrets" that anyone can use.

Winston Dev Tool Summary:
- What: Simple and universal logging library with support for multiple transports for Node.js
- Created by: Charlie Robbins (GitHub: indexzero)
- Current maintainer: David Hyde
- Best contact: https://github.com/winstonjs/winston

`live-keys` uses `winston` to provide a more verbose output on API failures. Logging from `winston` creates context with simple JavaScript time stamps and sliced 15 record files, for extra sight on API fails. API failures are typically not verbose, so having a little extra sight from chronology is helpful in an educational or presentation setting especially.

Husky Dev Tool Summary:
- What: Modern native Git hooks tool - makes Git hooks easy and automates commit/push tasks
- Created by: Typicode (GitHub: typicode)
- Maintainer: Typicode
- Best contact: https://github.com/typicode/husky (GitHub issues) or typicode@gmail.com

`live-keys` uses `husky` to prevent developer users from accidentally committing the real secrets they put in their keys.json file inside `live-keys`. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Husky is recommended for developers thinking about iterating `live-keys`. It prevents committing the `keys.json` file. You are circumventing standard best practice procedures to use `live-keys` because humans and AI know to guard .env files, and to store them in `keys.json` is unusual. This demonstrates the fundamentals of environment secrets.

# So how does it look? Screenshots and code: hooray!

![commands-screenshot.png](assets/commands-screenshot.png)

| Feature / Aspect | Traditional `.env` Approach | `live-keys` Approach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`.env` File Content** | Contains the actual secret key.<br> `API_KEY="sk-real-xxxxxxxx"` | Contains the URL of the key server.<br>`LIVE_KEYS_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:3666"` |
| **Secret Storage** | The real secret is stored in the `.env` file **within your main project's directory.** | The real secret is stored in a separate `keys.json` file, managed **only by the `live-keys` server.** |
| **Application Code** | Synchronously reads the key directly from the environment.<br>`const key = process.env.API_KEY;` | Asynchronously fetches the key from the `live-keys` local server.<br>`const key = await getApiKey('API_KEY');` |
| **Workflow for Streaming** | **Manual & Risky:**<br>1. Manually edit `.env` to replace the real key with a fake one.<br>2. Restart the application.<br>3. Remember to **never** show the `.env` file. | **Simple & Safe:**<br>1. Run a single command: `npm run stream:on`.<br>2. The application continues running without changes. |
| **Risk of Exposure** | **High.** If you accidentally show the `.env` file, `console.log(process.env)`, or a debugger variable, the **real secret is exposed.** | **Low.** The most you can expose is the placeholder value or the local server URL. |
| **Complexity** | **Very Simple.** This is the standard, built-in method for handling secrets in most frameworks. | **Adds a layer.** It requires running a second, separate server process alongside your main application. |

Your application code uses that single URL as a base. It then appends the name of the secret it needs to the end of the URL.
Here is a code example of how your application would fetch two different keys:

```javascript
const serverUrl = process.env.LIVE_KEYS_SERVER_URL;

// Fetch the OpenAI key
const openaiResponse = await fetch(`${serverUrl}/keys/OPENAI_API_KEY`);
const openaiData = await openaiResponse.json();
const openaiKey = openaiData.value; // This is the actual key/placeholder

// Fetch the Stripe key
const stripeResponse = await fetch(`${serverUrl}/keys/STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`);
const stripeData = await stripeResponse.json();
const stripeKey = stripeData.value; // This is the actual key/placeholder
```

### How does it affect coding?

*This is a critical point!*

 **You do need to write code differently in your main application to use `live-keys`.**

It represents a fundamental shift from a **synchronous, direct-access** pattern to an **asynchronous, request-based** pattern for handling your secrets.

Don't use it for production development, use it for public development.

Here is a  breakdown of the change:

---

### Before `live-keys`: Direct & Synchronous

Your code assumes the secret is immediately available in the environment.

*   **Logic:** "Get the variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `process.env` right now."
*   **Code:**
    ```javascript
    // The key is available instantly.
    const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY; 

    // You can use it immediately.
    const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: apiKey }); 
    ```

---

### After `live-keys`: Indirect & Asynchronous

Your code must now *ask* another service (the `live-keys` server) for the secret and *wait* for a response.

*   **Logic:** "Send a network request to the `live-keys` server for the key named `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and wait for it to reply with the value."
*   **Code:**
    ```javascript
    // You must use async/await because it's a network request.
    async function initializeApi() {
      const liveKeysUrl = process.env.LIVE_KEYS_SERVER_URL;
      const response = await fetch(`${liveKeysUrl}/keys/OPENAI_API_KEY`);
      const data = await response.json();
      const apiKey = data.value; // The value can now be used.

      const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: apiKey });
    }

    // You have to call the async function to start your app.
    initializeApi();
    ```

### Why This Change is Necessary and Powerful

This change in code, while requiring an adjustment, is precisely what makes `live-keys` secure and effective:

1.  **Decoupling:** Your main application is no longer directly coupled to the secret. It doesn't know the value, only how to ask for it.
2.  **Centralized Control:** This allows the `live-keys` server to act as a central switch. When you run `npm run stream:on`, it changes the value that gets sent back to your app, without your app ever needing to know or change.
3.  **No Leaks:** Because the real secret is never loaded into your main application's `process.env` when streaming, it's impossible for a stray `console.log` or debugger to accidentally expose it.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up and running `live-keys`.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher.
- **npm**: Included with Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Install the package**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs dependencies and creates `keys.json` and `live-keys.config.json` from templates.

2.  **Configure Your Keys & Features**
    -   **`keys.json`**: Add your real and placeholder API keys.
    -   **`live-keys.config.json`**: Configure the server's features.
        -   `strictMode` (boolean): If `true`, requests for missing keys return a `404 Not Found`. Defaults to `false`.
        -   `gitHook` (object): Configures the pre-commit hook.
            -   `enabled` (boolean): If `true`, the hook will run. Defaults to `false`.
            -   `mode` (string): Can be `'warn'` or `'block'`. Defaults to `'warn'`.

3.  **Set Up the Git Hook (Optional, but Recommended)**
    We recommend using `husky` to manage the git hooks reliably.
    ```bash
    npm install husky --save-dev
    npx husky install
    npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "node scripts/pre-commit.js"
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The server will start with a detailed banner confirming its status.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

You can control the server and perform checks using the following commands:

#### Controlling Streaming Mode
-   **`npm run stream:on`**: Turns streaming mode ON.
-   **`npm run stream:off`**: Turns streaming mode OFF.
-   **`npm run stream:toggle`**: Toggles the current mode.

#### Diagnostic Commands
-   **`npm run status`** (or `npx status`): Checks the live server's status, mode, and key request history.
-   **`npm run check-keys`** (or `npx check-keys`): Validates your `keys.json` file.
-   **`npm run key-commands`** (or `npx key-commands`): Displays a list of all available commands.

### Advanced Usage

#### Programmatic Access (Client-Side Helper)
For tighter integration, a client-side helper library is available in the `/code-base-files` directory. See the `README.md` in that directory for full instructions.

#### API Documentation
For detailed information on the server's endpoints, see the official `API.md` file in the project root.

#### API Endpoints
-   `GET /keys/:name`: Fetches a key. Returns `{ "key": "...", "value": "..." }` on success.
-   `GET /health`: Raw health check endpoint. Returns server status, mode, and request history.
-   `POST /stream-mode/toggle`: Toggles streaming mode. Accepts an optional body (`{ "mode": "on" }` or `{ "mode": "off" }`) to set a specific state.
-   `GET /config-check`: Validates the `keys.json` file.

### Testing Your Setup

You can perform a simple end-to-end test to validate the entire workflow.

**1. `fake-api.js` (A mock of a real API)**
```javascript
const http = require('http');
// This key must match a 'real' key in your keys.json
const REAL_API_KEY = 'sk-real-openai-key-goes-here'; 

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.headers['authorization'] === `Bearer ${REAL_API_KEY}`) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}).end(JSON.stringify({ message: '‚úÖ Success!' }));
  } else {
    res.writeHead(401, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}).end(JSON.stringify({ message: '‚ùå Unauthorized' }));
  }
}).listen(4001, () => console.log('Fake API listening on http://localhost:4001'));
```

**2. `run-test.js` (A script that simulates your app)**
```javascript
async function runTest() {
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3666/keys/OPENAI_API_KEY');
  const { value: apiKey } = await res.json();
  const apiRes = await fetch('http://localhost:4001', { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` } });
  console.log(`Fake API responded with: ${await apiRes.text()}`);
}
runTest();
```
Run `node test-app/fake-api.js` and `npm run dev` in separate terminals. Then run `node test-app/run-test.js`. Toggle streaming mode on and off to see the test succeed and fail.

---
## Deployment
For production environments, it is recommended to build the project and run the compiled JavaScript output.

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command uses `tsc` to compile the TypeScript files from `src/` into the `dist/` directory.

2.  **Run the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command runs the compiled `dist/server.js` file directly with Node.js.
